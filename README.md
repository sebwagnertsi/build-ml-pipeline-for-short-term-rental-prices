## Caveat:
I executed and ran the project completely on windows without the use of WSL.
For most parts, that didnt make a difference. 
However, when running command-line stuff windows can not take arguments in parentheses, so some
artifact descriptions look_like_this_with_underscores_instead_of_spaces.
But thats just cosmetic.

However, the commandline hydra options never worked with the $(echo) statement. Thats why there are multiple command lines in my main MLproject file.
By the time I encountered these issues, i was too far into the project to change to WSL.
Sorry!
